# Prediction of Sea Ice in Northern Hemisphere

Sea ice is frozen sea water that floats on the surface of ocean. This floating ice has a profound influence on the polar environment, influencing ocean circulation, weather, and regional climate.

# Goal of the project

1. Prediction of change in the sea ice extent of Northern Hemisphere till 2122 using time series analysis
2. Analysis of sea ice extent in three main regions of Northern Hemisphere
3. Visualization of the change of sea ice extent

## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.9.4

## Setup

For this purpose you use following commands:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Unit testing (Optional)

If you write python scripts for your data processing methods, you can also write unit tests. In order to run the tests execute in terminal:

```bash
pytest
```

This command will execute all the functions in your project that start with the word **test**.
